# IMPORTANT!!!

development of the felix mod will be stalled because of the animations.

detailed reason:

me with the animator for this project figured out that the only way to use gecko lib (or any forks like azure) require the use of blockbench, except its actual dogshit.
jajkoczlowiek is only used to blender ~~(and literally only blender lmao)~~.

so until we find a way to make the animations in blender or some other similar software (preferably not absolute shit), development will be nearly fully ceased/stalled.


# THE Felix Mod
“Nyaa! Felix is here to help you, nya~!”

The Felix Mod is a work-in-progress Minecraft mod that adds a new friendly (and slightly mischievous) companion to your world — Felix Argyle!

### Features
- Interactive NPC: Talk to Felix, trade with him, or just enjoy his company.
- Combat Assistance: Felix can fight mobs alongside you and protect your base.
- (WIP) More features to come — dialogue, custom _[animations](https://github.com/programming-artist-py/the-felix-mod/blob/main/README.md#important)_, and special events!

### Status
This mod is still in early development. Expect updates, tweaks, and plenty of bugs to squash (hopefully not the cute kind).

### Credits
Inspired by Felix Argyle from Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World.
