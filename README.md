# IMPORTANT!!!

development of the felix mod will be stalled because of the animations.

detailed reason:

me along with the animator for this project figured out that the only way to use gecko lib (or any forks like azure) require the use of blockbench, except its actual dogshit.
jajkoczlowiek is only used to blender ~~(and literally only blender lmao)~~.

so until we find a way to make the animations in blender or some other similar software (preferably not absolute shit), development will be nearly fully ceased/stalled.
If you know a good solution or workaround, PLEASE share this. I am desperate to get this mod done so that I can start working on another. PLEASE... PLEASE

# THE Felix Mod
~ Felix is here to help you~! ~

The Felix Mod is a work-in-progress Minecraft mod that adds a new friendly (and slightly mischievous) companion to your world — Felix Argyle!

### Features
- Interactive NPC: Talk to Felix, trade with him, or just enjoy his company.
- Combat Assistance: Felix can fight mobs alongside you and protect your base.
- (WIP) More features to come — dialogue, custom _[animations](https://github.com/programming-artist-py/the-felix-mod/blob/main/README.md#important)_, and special events!

### Status
This mod is still in early development. Expect updates, tweaks, and plenty of bugs to squash (hopefully not the cute kind).

### Recipes

**to craft the cum bucket / cum-filled bucket:**

Place a bucket in the center and in all 3 slots above it, place cum balls

**to craft the cum popsicle / cum on a stick:**

Place a stick in the center and to either it's top-left or top-right, place a cum ball

Serpentine is a lightweight configuration mod made by me ~~exclusively for the felix mod, it doesn't really have compatibility with having multiple mods need to use its config screen though...~~ it also has compatibility with multiple mods using its config screen now!
